## Topic

FEASIBILITY AND INVESTMENT OF A BREAD FACTORY; Establishing a business is an event that involves economic, technical, financial, and legal aspects. Therefore, to establish a successful business, establishment studies must be initiated and conducted in accordance with a number of key principles. The business at the establishment stage is referred to as a project or investment project. The project determines the raw materials to be used, production methods, and the quantity and quality of goods to be produced. The business materials, facilities, vehicles, and equipment acquired for the establishment are all investments. To make an investment decision, the entrepreneur collects preliminary ideas about the most suitable topics and the place to invest. For this purpose;
1. The status of the raw materials required for the investment
2. Domestic and foreign market status of investment goods
• Cost of goods produced
• Price elasticity of goods
• Size and location of the project
• Required capacities
• Investment amount
• Information on investment financing
are acquired. In short, these types of studies highlighted are the studies that we need to do in feasibility. Feasibility studies are economic, technical, and financial studies conducted before preparing a definite project for investment. Economic studies generally include market research, demand estimation, determination of the operating capacity, and location selection issues. The technical study includes the technical definition of the project, soil studies of the site where the facilities will be established, raw and auxiliary material studies, definition of the production method, reasons for choosing that method, patent issues, types of goods, by-products and waste produced, physical and chemical properties of waste in terms of environmental pollution, and the possibility of evaluating waste. The reasons for preferring the machines and equipment to be used in the business, whether they will be obtained domestically or from abroad, their qualities, lifetimes, and costs, the layout plans of the facilities, water, electricity, fuel needs, and types of the facility, the form and characteristics of the internal and external road connections of the facility, how and by whom the assembly work will be carried out, and the cost of these works are all included in the technical study. The financial study calculates the investment amount, estimates the income and expenditure of the business, and conducts financial studies and organizations.
Based on all of these studies, we have conducted a study on the feasibility of a bread factory.
